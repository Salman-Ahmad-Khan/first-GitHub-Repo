    <title>HTML Basic Tags</title>

    <!-- Heading Tags
Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. HTML also 
has six levels of headings, which use the elements <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and 
<h6>. While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that 
heading.
-->
    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
    <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
    <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
    <h4>This is heading 4</h4>
    <h5>This is heading 5</h5>
    <h6>This is heading 6</h6>

    <!--Paragraph Tag
The <p> tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph of 
text should go in between an opening <p> and a closing </p> tag as shown below in the 
example:  -->

    <p> Here is the first paragraph of text.</p>
    <p> Here is the second paragraph of text.</p>
    <p> Here is the third paragraph of text.</p>

    <!--Line Break Tag
Whenever you use the <br /> element, anything following it starts from the next line. This 
tag is an example of an empty element, where you do not need opening and closing tags, as 
there is nothing to go in between them.
The <br /> tag has a space between the characters br and the forward slash. If you omit this 
space, older browsers will have trouble rendering the line break, while if you miss the forward 
slash character and just use <br> it is not valid in XHTML.  -->
    <p>Hello<br />You delivered your assignment on time.<br />Thanks<br />Salman
    </p>

    <!-- Centering Content
You can use <center> tag to put any content in the center of the page or any table cell. -->
    <p>This text is not in the centre.<br />
        <center>This text is in the center</center>
    </p>

    <!-- Horizontal Lines
Horizontal lines are used to visually break-up sections of a document. The <hr> tag creates 
a line from the current position in the document to the right margin and breaks the line 
accordingly.
 -->

    <p>This is paragraph one and should be on the top</p>
    <hr>
    <p>This is paragraph two and should be at the bottom</p>


    <!-- Preserve Formatting
Sometimes, you want your text to follow the exact format of how it is written in the HTML 
document. In these cases, you can use the preformatted tag <pre>.
Any text between the opening <pre> tag and the closing </pre> tag will preserve the 
formatting of the source document. -->


    without preformatted tag <br />
    function testFunction( strText ){
    alert ( strText )
    }

    <p>with preformatted tag<br />
    <pre> function testFunction( strText ){
    alert ( strText )
}</pre>
    </p>

    <!--Nonbreaking Spaces
Suppose you want to use the phrase "12 Angry Men." Here, you would not want a browser to 
split the "12, Angry" and "Men" across two lines:
An example of this technique appears in the movie "12 Angry Men."
In cases, where you do not want the client browser to break text, you should use a 
nonbreaking space entity &nbsp; instead of a normal space. For example, when coding the 
"12 Angry Men" in a paragraph, you should use something similar to the following code:  -->

    <p>
        An example of this technique appears in the movie
        "12&nbsp;Angry&nbsp;Men."
    </p>


    <!--HTML Tag vs. Element
An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it ends 
with a closing tag.
For example, <p> is starting tag of a paragraph and </p> is closing tag of the same 
paragraph but <p>This is paragraph</p> is a paragraph element.  -->

    <h1>This is <i>italic</i> heading</h1>
    <h2>The word <u>underlined</u> is <u>underlined</u> here</h2>
