<!-- Internationalization Attributes
There are three internationalization attributes, which are available for most (although not all) 
XHTML elements.
 dir
 lang
 xml:lang -->
<!-- The dir Attribute:
The dir attribute allows you to indicate to the browser about the direction in which the text 
should flow. -->
<!-- When dir attribute is used within the <html> tag, it determines how text will be presented 
within the entire document. When used within another tag, it controls the text's direction for 
just the content of that tag. -->


<html dir="ltr" lang="en">

<head>

    <!-- ATTRIBUTE:
 An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the 
element's opening tag. All attributes are made up of two parts: a name and a value:

 The name is the property you want to set. For example, the paragraph <p> element 
in the example carries an attribute whose name is align, which you can use to indicate 
the alignment of paragraph on the page.

 The value is what you want the value of the property to be set and always put within 
quotations. The below example shows three possible values of align attribute: left, 
center and right.-->

    <p align="left"> This is left aligned</p>
    <p align="center"> This is center aligned</p>
    <p align="right"> This is right aligned</p>

    <!-- Core Attributes
The four core attributes that can be used on the majority of HTML elements (although not all) 
are:
 Id
 Title
 Class
 Style -->

    <!--The Id Attribute
The id attribute of an HTML tag can be used to uniquely identify any element within an HTML 
page. There are two primary reasons that you might want to use an id attribute on an 
element:
 If an element carries an id attribute as a unique identifier, it is possible to identify just 
that element and its content.
 If you have two elements of the same name within a Web page (or style sheet), you 
can use the id attribute to distinguish between elements that have the same name.
  -->

    <p id="html" title="This para explains what HTML is."> This para explains what <i>HTML</i> is.</p>

    <p id="css" title="This para explains what Cascading Style Sheet is">This para explains what <i>Cascading Style
            Sheet</i> is.</p>

    <!-- The title Attribute
The title attribute gives a suggested title for the element. The syntax for the title attribute 
is similar as explained for id attribute:
The behavior of this attribute will depend upon the element that carries it, although it is often 
displayed as a tooltip when cursor comes over the element or while the element is loading. -->

    <h3 title="Hello HTML!">Titled heading tag example.</h3>

    <!-- The class Attribute
The class attribute is used to associate an element with a style sheet, and specifies the class 
of element. 
The value of the attribute may also be a space-separated list of class names. For example: -->

    <!-- When dir attribute is used within the <html> tag, it determines how text will be presented 
within the entire document. When used within another tag, it controls the text's direction for 
just the content of that tag. -->

    <p class="className1 className2 className3" title="The class attribute is used to associate an element with a style sheet, and specifies the class 
of element. 
The value of the attribute may also be a space-separated list of class names
When dir attribute is used within the <html> tag, it determines how text will be presented 
within the entire document. When used within another tag, it controls the text's direction for 
just the content of that tag. 
" dir="rtl">The class attribute is used to associate an element with a style sheet, and specifies the class
        of element.
        The value of the attribute may also be a space-separated list of class names</p>

    <!--The style Attribute
The style attribute allows you to specify Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) rules within the element.
  -->
    <p title="The style Attribute
  The style attribute allows you to specify Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) rules within the element.
  " style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; color: #ff0000;">Some Text</p>
